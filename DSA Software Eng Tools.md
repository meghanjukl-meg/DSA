## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE

- structured process to design ,develop and test good quality software 
- 5 stages 
    1. Planning / Requirement Analysis
    2. Design
    3. Implementation / Development 
    4. Testing 
    5. Deployment

## Models


#### Sequential models

-   **Waterfall Model**
    
    A linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next one begins. It's suitable for projects with well-defined requirements and low risk.
    

-   **V-Model**
    
    A variation of the Waterfall model that emphasizes testing. For every development phase, there is a corresponding testing phase.
    

#### Iterative and incremental models

-   **Spiral Model**
    
    Combines elements of iterative development with the systematic aspects of Waterfall. It focuses on risk management and is divided into four quadrants: determination of objectives, risk assessment and reduction, development, and evaluation.
    

-   **[Incremental and Iterative Model]**
    
    -   **Incremental:** The project is broken down into smaller increments, and each increment is developed and delivered.
        
    
    -   **Iterative:** The project is built in repeating cycles, with each cycle (or iteration) refining the product based on previous feedback.
        
    

-   **Agile Model:**
    
    An umbrella term for various methodologies that emphasize *flexibility, collaboration, and rapid delivery.*
    
    -   **Scrum:** An agile framework where work is done in time-boxed iterations called "sprints".
                  -Each module : EPIC
                  
        
    
    -   **Kanban:** An agile method focused on continuous delivery and visualizing workflows.
        
    
    -   **Extreme Programming (XP):** An agile framework that uses practices like pair programming and test-driven development to improve software quality.
        
    

#### Other models

-   **Prototyping Model**
    
    Involves creating a working prototype first to gather user feedback before the full development begins.
    

-   **Rapid Application Development (RAD)**
    
    Focuses on rapid prototyping and iterative development to deliver a working system quickly.
