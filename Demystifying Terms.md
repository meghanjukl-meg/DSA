### Data Science

 The science of analysing and extracting information from large sets of data, which typically combines elements of statistics,maths,computing, and other subjects
 i.e  extract meaningful insights from data to make better decisions

### Machine Learning

   Machine learning is when a computer learns from training datasets to make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed for every task
       - subset of artificial intelligence
 Example : Image recognition


###  Artificial Intelligence
    
   The ability of computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving.
     It allows machines to analyze data, find patterns, make decisions, and adapt their behavior to achieve specific goals.
    - mimics human intelligence
    - Drives automation
         AI is used to automate tasks that would otherwise require a human, freeing up people to focus on more creative work.
   Examples : voice assistants, recommendation systems on platforms like YouTube, and self-driving cars.

##### Key factors that helped in growth
- Explosion of data & its generation with digital devices
- Advancements in computing power
- Algorithmic improvements
#### Agentic AI
that can autonomously set goals, plan, and take actions to achieve them with minimal human intervention
 
##### The Nobel Prize in Physics 2024 
 John J. Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton "for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks"

### Ethical Considerations in AI


1.**Fairness and bias:**

AI systems can perpetuate and amplify biases present in their training data, leading to discriminatory outcomes. 
Addressing this requires using diverse data sets and employing tools to detect and mitigate bias

2. **Right to Privacy and Data Protection**

 Privacy must be protected and promoted throughout the AI lifecycle. Adequate data protection frameworks should also be established.
 This involves secure data management, encryption, anonymization, and adherence to privacy laws.
 3. **Misuse and misinformation:**
    
   AI technologies can be used to create deepfakes and spread misinformation, posing societal risks that require regulation and safeguards.

4.**Societal impact:**

 impact on employment, the environment, and the potential for AI to exacerbate existing societal inequalities

5.**Human Safety**

AI systems must not create harm to people.

6.**Responsibility and Accountability**

AI systems should be auditable and traceable. There should be oversight, impact assessment, audit and due diligence mechanisms in place to avoid conflicts with human rights norms and threats to environmental wellbeing.

#### Correlation v/s causation

A key difference->correlation does not imply causation; 
                  a relationship between two variables could be coincidental or be influenced by a third, unobserved factor
