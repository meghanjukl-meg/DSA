## BASICS

#### Object oriented programming
 - uses "objects" to design software, where each object contains data in the form of fields (or attributes) and code in the form of procedures (or methods)
 - ### oops concepts
 #### 1. Class

A class is a collection of objects.  A class defines a set of attributes and methods that the created objects (instances) can have.
#### 2. Objects

An Object is an instance of a Class. It represents a specific implementation of the class and holds its own data.
####  3. Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class (child class) to acquire properties and methods of another class (parent class). It supports hierarchical classification and promotes code reuse.
#### 4. Polymorphism

Polymorphism in Python means "same operation, different behavior." It allows functions or methods with the same name to work differently depending on the type of object they are acting upon.
#### 5. Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) within a class, restricting access to some components to control interactions.
#### 6. Data Abstraction

Abstraction hides the internal implementation details while exposing only the necessary functionality. It helps focus on "what to do" rather than "how to do it."

 #### High Level language
- allow programmers to write code that is more readable, maintainable, and portable
- user friendly
- Python, Java, and C++
#### Interpreted language
- This means that Python code is executed line-by-line by a Python interpreter at runtime, rather than being fully compiled into machine code before execution.

#### Dynamic Sematics
- Variables are not declared with a fixed type:


open source
#### Platform independence
-  Python code can be executed on various hardware platforms (like Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.) without significant modifications
